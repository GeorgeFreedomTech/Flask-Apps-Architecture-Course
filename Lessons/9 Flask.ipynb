    "\n",
    "### The Philosophy of Flask\n",
    "* With Flask, we start with the absolute functional minimum.\n",
    "* We add only what is needed and only when we want to add it.\n",
    "* We retain full control over the project because we are not overwhelmed by the multitude of options and settings; project development is gradual.\n",
    "* With great freedom comes great responsibility; we are responsible for the final architecture and structuring of the project ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Take Away: Your New Skills\n",
    "By completing this course, you have acquired a comprehensive set of skills for developing modern web applications. You can now:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create dynamic web pages using **Flask** and the **Jinja2** templating system.\n",
    "* Process user input using robust **WTF-Forms**.\n",
    "* Work with a database (save, read, update, and delete data) using **SQLAlchemy**.\n",
    "* Structure code into a scalable architecture with an **Application Factory** and **Blueprints**.\n",
    "* Design and build simple **REST APIs** for machine-to-machine communication.\n",
    "* Prepare and **deploy an application** to a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to this, you are able to build projects such as dynamic **web applications/pages** (like blogs or portfolios), **data management applications** (user or product records), or a **backend system with a REST API** for mobile or JavaScript applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for future Improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Increase System Robustness:** Now that your application is functional, focus on its quality and reliability. Explore writing automated tests (e.g., using `pytest`) to verify your systems' functionality after every change, and consider additional security features (authentication and authorization).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Publish Your Missions:** Your projects shouldn't remain secret. Create a portfolio on GitHub and upload your code. A successful application deployment to a service like Render is the best proof of your skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Become a Chronicler of Your Expeditions:** Document the development process, the problems you faced, and their solutions. Create and maintain `readme` files on GitHub as your logbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Update Your Technology:** Technology is constantly evolving. Return to your old code from time to time with new knowledge and perform refactoring. Every upgrade is the mark of an experienced engineer."
