    "## 10.1. The Philosophy of Flask:\n",
    "Flask provides a functional minimum; we add components only when our project truly requires them and exactly when they are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have full control over the project because we are not overwhelmed by a multitude of options and configurations for every possible feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since there is no enforced application structure, we are responsible for defining it ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.2 Mission Outcomes: Our New Skills\n",
    "By completing this course, we have acquired a comprehensive skill set for developing modern web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We are now able to:\n",
    "- Create `dynamic web pages` using **Flask** and the **Jinja2** templating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Handle user input` using robust **WTF forms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Work with databases` (create, read, update, and delete data) using **SQLAlchemy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structure code into a `scalable architecture` using **Application Factory** and **Blueprints**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design and build simple `REST APIs` for **machine-to-machine communication**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Prepare and deploy` the application to a **production environment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to this, we are capable of building `dynamic web applications/sites` (such as blogs or portfolios), `data management applications` (user or product registries), or a `backend system with a REST API` for mobile or JavaScript applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.3. Next Frontiers (Tips for Improvement)\n",
    "1. **Increase System Robustness:** \n",

    "    - Your projects shouldn't remain classified. Create a portfolio on GitHub, upload your code, and try deploying a selected application (Render, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Become a Chronicler of Your Expeditions:** \n",
    "    - Document the development process, the challenges you faced, and your solutions. Create and maintain README files on GitHub to serve as your **captain's log**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update Your Technology:** \n",
