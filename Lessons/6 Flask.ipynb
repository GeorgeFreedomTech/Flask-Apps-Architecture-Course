    "## 6.1. RESTful API Principles\n",
    "For communication between different systems to work reliably, everyone must follow the same rules and protocols. For APIs, the REST architecture is such a standard, defining a set of best practices for designing clear and predictable data interfaces. Let's look at the basic rules that will ensure our API is understandable to any system that wants to connect to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### REST RULES:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Stateless` - every client request to the server must contain ALL the information needed for successful processing = it does not rely on previous conversation.\n",
    "- `Client-server` - the client (= the one who asks and sends data requests) and the server (= the one who responds and sends responses based on the request) are independent = the client handles the user interface and data display, the server supplies and processes data based on requests.\n",
    "- `Cacheable` - the response object must state (cacheable/non-cacheable) whether, and for how long, the data is \"valid\".\n",
    "- `Layered system` - there can be multiple intermediate layers between the client and the server (other servers, satellites ..) for better load balancing = the client does not know if it is communicating directly with the end server.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Uniform interface`- a unified interface and principles for client-server communication:\n",
    "  - **Identification** - clear and unambiguous identification of information and data resources = unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) addresses - usually unique URL addresses.\n",
    "    `\"/sensors/temperature\"` is the resource for data from the temperature sensor.\n",
    "  - **Representation** - we never work directly with the resource, but with its representation = usually a response in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.\n",
    "  - **Self-descriptive messages** - each request and each response contain the information needed to understand them.\n",
    "    - = the request uses HTTP methods to manipulate resources/data: GET (to retrieve), POST (to create), PUT (to update), and DELETE (to delete).\n",
    "    - = the response in the response header: `Content-Type: application/json` (the data being sent is in JSON format).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- Data is available at selected URLs in the form of JSON files.\n",
    "- Data can be obtained as a response when we ask correctly using an HTTP method - e.g., PUT to update data.\n",
    "- These are just principles of polite communication :)"

We will explore how to use the `jsonify()` function to package our data into a universal JSON container and how to use `make_response()` to add special metadata and instructions to the data shipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `jsonify()`:\n",
    "  - Creates a response in `JSON` format.\n",
    "  - We pass ARG/ARGs or KWARG/KWARGs, and the resulting list/dict will be converted to JSON.\n",
    "  - We can add **status codes** (200, 300, 400, etc.).\n",
