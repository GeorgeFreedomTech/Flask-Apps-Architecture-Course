    "**1. Establishing the Databank and Defining Schemas:**\n",
    "- Create the files `database.py` and `models.py`.\n",
    "- In `models.py`, define the `CrewMember` database model, which will correspond to the structure of our crew from the original list.\n",
    "- In the configuration file, set up the connection to the SQLite database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Initial Data Upload (Data Seeding):**\n",
    "- In the main application file (e.g., `my_app.py`), take the existing `my_crew` list and write code that **once** inserts these four crew members into your new database table.\n",
    "- **Key Maneuver:** Use a conditional check (`if not CrewMember.query.first():`) to ensure the data is loaded only on the first run when the databank is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Refactoring Read Protocols (READ operations):**\n",
    "- We can remove the global `my_crew` variable from our application.\n",
    "- Modify the view functions for the `/crew_members` and `/crew_members/<int:id>` routes so that they load data directly from your new database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Refactoring the Write Protocol (CREATE operation):**\n",
    "- Modify the view function for the `/onboarding` route. The logic that added a new member to the list after form submission must now be replaced with logic that creates a new instance of the `CrewMember` model and saves it to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Final Systems Check:**\n",
    "- Run the application and verify that you see 4 crew members loaded from the database on the `/crew_members` page.\n",
    "- Using the form at `/onboarding`, add a new (fifth) member.\n",
    "- **Restart the server** (stop and restart the application).\n",
    "- Re-open the `/crew_members` page. If you see all 5 members, your mission was successful – you have created a persistent data store!"
