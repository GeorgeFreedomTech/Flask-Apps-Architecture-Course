    "# 1. Flask - Introduction to the Framework\n",
    "## 1.1. Introduction\n",
    "- Flask is a simple framework for creating web applications in Python with a low learning curve.\n",
    "- It was created in 2010 by Armin Ronacher.\n",
    "- Its core is built on two key components:\n",
    "  - `Werkzeug`: A reliable `WSGI` (Web Server Gateway Interface) engine that handles communication between our server and the application.\n",
    "  - `Jinja2`: A powerful templating system for generating dynamic HTML pages from data and templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Flask` emphasizes:\n",
    "- **Simplicity and minimalism:** We start with only the essentials.\n",
    "- **Extensibility:** We build the application like a toolkit, adding modules only as our mission requires them.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** It gives us full control over the architecture and the tools used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operating Systems: FLASK vs. DJANGO\n",
    "Let's imagine we are creating control software for a spaceship.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **FLASK (Our Choice):** It's like a modular electronics kit. We start with a powerful core processor (`Werkzeug`) and a display module (`Jinja2`). All other components—sensors, navigation, communication modules—are added progressively. This is ideal for rapid development, specialized probes, APIs, and control panels like ours.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **DJANGO:** It's like a complete, off-the-shelf space shuttle from NASA with a fixed structure and many built-in systems. It's perfect for large, complex missions (like managing an entire space station) where standardization and security are top priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Installation and Environment Setup\n",
    "- First, we need to ensure we have Python installed.\n",
    "- **Recommendation:** Use a virtual environment (`venv`) for each project = an isolated laboratory for each of our missions.\n",
    "- Installing Flask in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "  pip install flask\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Verifying the installation:\n",
