    "Our current Mission Control system works, but it's a monolithic prototype where all systems are hardwired together. In this lesson, we will perform a major upgrade: we will learn to build the core of our application using the **Application Factory** pattern, which separates the system's construction from its execution. This will allow us to easily run our system in different configurations and prepare an external \"docking port\" (`wsgi.py`) for future deployment to production servers."
