    "- We can have `any number` of BPs in the application.\n",
    "- We can add and separate BPs in the application (in the Application Factory) as needed.\n",
    "- Each BP will have \"its own things\" - routes, files, forms, permissions, settings, style, and appearance, or whatever else it needs - and at the same time, it can also use `global elements` (base templates and HTML elements, files, layout ..).\n",
    "- If we set **`template_folder=`** for HTML files when defining a BP - Flask will look for templates `first in the specified BP folder` - and if it doesn't find the file, it will use the **global `templates/` folder**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will use Blueprints for:\n",
    "  1. An application composed of different elements / components - user, admin, API ..\n",
    "  2. If we want to reuse Blueprint code between multiple projects - e.g., authentication, API.\n",
    "  3. Easily adding logically grouped routes to the application.\n",
